    Cutco is a company driven to create a great experience for both its customers and employees. I began as an intern in November and by April I was promoted to full time programmer. I am more focused on backend issues working to protect the integrity of the data but still make it accessible to the right users.
    
    I work primarily in SQL, RPG, and Python.
