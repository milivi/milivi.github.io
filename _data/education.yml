    While at St. Bonaventure I spent time exploring subjects from Spanish to accounting to computer science. I learned time management and perseverence. My favorite CS courses were Database Management and Software Engineering. 

    Outside of the classroom I spent my time playing field hockey on our club team, eventually becoming captain.  I also enjoyed being a host on The Buzz, our radio station.
